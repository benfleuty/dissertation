\begin{itemize}
\item Record of important contributions to your field of work by others
\item Critical evaluation of the work to date
\item More in-depth and focused discussion than in your proposal
\item Focus on actual technologies now being used
\item Current state of play
\item Start with a short introduction of what the chapter is about
\item References to support arguments
\item Lead reader to the same position as you
\item End with a summary of significant points leading into your methodology
\item Your guide should be 1700-1850 words in length
\end{itemize}

Consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What views need to be (further) tested?
\item What evidence is lacking, inconclusive, contradictory or too limited?
\item Why study (further) the research problem?
\item What contribution can the present study be expected to make?
\item What research designs or methods seem unsatisfactory?
\end{itemize}
